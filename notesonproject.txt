What I'm learning:
1. Basics about React components: how to create them, export them, import them, use them
2. CSS basics and styling
3. Writing JSX to display elements on the screen


Questions:
1. There's spacing between the main component and the navbar component, not sure why.
    - there's some collapsing margin with the top of the h1 that's pushing the main section down
    - tip: put background on the body, so we don't have to worry about the collapsing margin
